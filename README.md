### Hello guys 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🖥️ I'm a backend developer
- 🎯 Currently my focus is on the development of restFull APIs, using typescript, Node.js, NestJs, using relational or non-relational databases with type ORM.
- 📚 I will always be uploading study repositories in backend.

### Be welcome 🤝
